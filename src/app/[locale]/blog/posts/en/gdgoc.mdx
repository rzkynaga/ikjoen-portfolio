The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step—or in my case, a small dream. Ever since I started my academic life as a freshman, I’ve been captivated by the allure of GDSC (now GDGoC) at Unsri. The idea of being part of a tech community that values collaboration, innovation, and learning sparked something in me. It was more than just a group; it was a gateway to becoming the best version of myself as a tech enthusiast. But as much as I admired the community, my path toward becoming a part of it has been anything but straightforward.

## First Attempt: A Humbling Experience

In my first semester, I eagerly signed up for the selection process. I prepared for days, reading up on the program, brushing up on my technical skills, and practicing for the interview. My excitement was at its peak. However, the reality of the selection process quickly humbled me.

During the interview, I stumbled. My answers were underwhelming, my technical knowledge wasn’t sharp enough, and my lack of experience shone through. Needless to say, I didn’t make it. The rejection stung, but it also fueled my desire to grow. I promised myself that I would come back stronger.

## Second Attempt: Battling Circumstances

By the time my second year rolled around, I felt more prepared. I had gained more knowledge, worked on personal projects, and even improved my communication skills. When the next selection process opened, I confidently signed up again.

This time, the initial stages went well. I completed the assignments and even impressed myself with the effort I had put in. But life threw me a curveball. Just before the final stage of the selection process, I fell ill. It wasn’t just a minor setback—I was too unwell to finish the final assignment. I had to withdraw from the process, watching my dream slip away for the second time.

## Third Attempt: The Determined Comeback

Now in my third year, I find myself standing at the threshold once again. The selection process for GDGoC Unsri 2024 has begun, and this time, my resolve is unshakable. I’ve spent the past months not just honing my technical skills but also reflecting on the lessons from my previous attempts. I’ve learned that persistence isn’t about avoiding failure—it’s about refusing to give up.

This time, I’m approaching the process with a renewed mindset. I’m diving deep into the assignments, preparing thoroughly for the interview, and reminding myself of the passion that started it all. I know the competition is fierce, and the outcome isn’t guaranteed. But what sets this attempt apart is the growth I’ve experienced along the way.

## Looking Forward

While I’m still in the midst of the selection process, my ambition to become part of GDGoC has never been greater. This journey has taught me resilience, the value of learning from failure, and the importance of perseverance. Even if the outcome isn’t what I hope for, I know that I’m walking away with invaluable experience and growth.

The dream that started in my first semester is still alive, stronger than ever. And whether or not this year marks the culmination of my efforts, I’ll continue to strive for excellence, knowing that every step of this journey has shaped the person I am today.

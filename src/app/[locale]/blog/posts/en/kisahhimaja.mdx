## The Beginning: A Sound Operator Behind the Scenes  

When I first joined Himaja Unsri, I was just an ordinary member—perhaps best described as an *NPC* (Non-Playable Character). My role was simple: operating the sound system during one of the organization's programs. Working behind the scenes, I ensured everything ran smoothly, often without anyone noticing my presence.  

However, it was through this humble role that my affection for Himaja began to grow. I learned that an organization is not just about the spotlight and grandeur but about how every small part contributes to the collective success.  

## The First Step in Leadership: Vice Chair of Dies Natalis 2022  

My first significant opportunity came in 2022 when I was entrusted with the role of Vice Chair for the Himaja Unsri Dies Natalis celebration. This event became a turning point for me. From planning to execution, I learned about the complexities of managing a large-scale program, facing logistical challenges, and maintaining team morale.  

As vice chair, my responsibilities went beyond assisting the chair in decision-making; I also acted as a bridge between the team and the committee. This experience taught me the meaning of greater responsibility and how leadership is not just about leading but also about serving others.  

## The Ultimate Challenge: Chairing Sriwijaya Besanjo 2024  

The following year, I was given the immense responsibility of leading *Sriwijaya Besanjo 2024* as its Chairperson. This was a much larger role. Sriwijaya Besanjo wasn’t just an ordinary event—it was a grand program involving over 500 participants, cultural elements, and collaborations with external communities.  

Through this long journey, my presence in Himaja became more prominent, and my love for the organization deepened. I experienced firsthand how Himaja provided space for its members to grow, experiment, and learn from their mistakes.  

As the chairperson, I faced numerous challenges, from securing sponsors to managing a large team. However, overcoming these obstacles strengthened my belief that Himaja was my second home.  

## A Resolve to Lead  

After this long journey, I decided to run for Chairman of Himaja Unsri during the General Assembly. For me, this wasn’t just about personal ambition; it was a commitment to giving back to the organization that had given so much to me.  

I believe that being Chairman means being a leader who serves. I aim to ensure that every member—from those on stage to those working behind the scenes—feels valued and has the space to grow.  

## Closing Thoughts  

My journey from an *NPC* to Chairman wasn’t easy, but it was deeply meaningful. Every step, from being a sound operator to vice chair and eventually chairperson, has shaped me into a stronger individual ready to face greater challenges.  

Himaja Unsri has been a place where I’ve learned, grown, and found a deep sense of belonging. Now, as Chairman, I am ready to lead Himaja toward a brighter future, continuing to make meaningful contributions to its members and the community.
